Q: Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.

A:
1:  for (e = table[i]; e != 0; e = e->next) {
2:    if (e->key == key)
3:      break;
4:  }
5:  if(e){
6:    // update the existing key.
7:    e->value = value;
8:  } else {
9:    // the new is new.
10:   insert(key, value, &table[i], table[i]);
11: }

Thread 1 and 2 are hit the same bucket. Then thread 1 and 2
both run into loop and not find any matched keys.
Then both threads run into line 10 and insert() 
with same 3rd & 4th arguments.
In the function insert, both threads execute 
`*p = e` with same `*p`;
